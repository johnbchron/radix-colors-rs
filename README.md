# radix-colors-rs

I got tired of manually copying Radix colors into my projects, so I made this crate.
It contains a mini JS project and some Nix code to produce a `colors.json` file.
This file is parsed by rust macros to generate the color constants.

If you're coming from some other language, you're welcome also to just use the `colors.json` file as is.
